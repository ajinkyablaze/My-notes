Create a object of another class
Human tom;
tom = new Human();



Use variables from other class for the object
tom.age = 5;



Use methods on the object
tom.speak();



Inheritance of classes
If a class 'Bird' is inherited from another class 'Animal', write
public class Bird extends Animal

Add similar constructor like 'Animal' in 'Bird'
e.g. If there is a constructor in 'Animal' like this,

public Animal(int age, String gender){
}

Add in 'Bird'

public Bird(int age, String gender){
	super(age, gender);
}

'super' calls super-class' constructor.

Child can inherit the variables and methods from parent, but not reverse. Methods of class 'Animal' can be called on a object of 'Bird', but methods explicitly defined in 'Bird' cannot be called in 'Animal'.
