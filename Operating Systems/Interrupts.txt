Memory hierarchy :
As we go down the hierarchy, this occures:
(1) Decreasing cost per bit
(2) Increasing capacity
(3) Increasing access time
(4) Decreasing frequency of access to the memory by the processor

Inbound memory -> REgisters, Cache, Main memory
Outboard storage -> Magnetic disk, CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, Blu-Ray
Off-line storage -> Magnetic tape
